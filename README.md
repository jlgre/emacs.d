# Luke Green's Emacs Configuration
This is my emacs configuration loosely based on [Steven Purcell's](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d). 
Mostly I have copied his structure.

## Purpose
This is my personal config for software development, and supports some of the technologies I use.
I will be adding documentation here as I get around to it.

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/jlgre/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d`
